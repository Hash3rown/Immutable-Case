# Immutable - Monetizing Gaming for the Player
## Overview and Origin
![Logo](/images/logo.jpg)

* Name of company

Immutable PTY LTD, formerly FUEL Games

* When was the company incorporated?

24 September 2020

* Who are the founders of the company?

James and Robbie Ferguson

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founders of Immutable developed 'Gods Unchained', a play-to-earn digital trading card game built on the Ethereum blockchain. The challenges brought about by the immense success of this game lead to the development of Immutable. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The company is privately funded, recently raising more than $15m in a series A round in 2020.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Immutable aims to disrupt the gaming industry by putting the value of in-game collectibles/purchases back in the hands of the player. In-Game purchases on unique items, skins, upgrades and expansions represent one of the biggest revenue streams for major video game platforms but, in most cases the player does not stand to benefit from this market. Immutable aims to solve this by creating a peer to peer marketplace for gaming collectibles where players decide the value of items being sold.
Additionally the cost and speed of transacting directly on the Ethereum blockchain is ever-increasing as the network grows, becomes more congested and struggles to keep up with it's own network-effect. Immutable offers Immutable X to combat this - a scaling solution for game developers to build on. Immutable x's technology dramatically increases the speed of transactions on it's marketplace as well as reducing costs - without compromising on the level of security and decentralization at the core of the host blockchain.


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Immutable's website claims that "$100bn was spent on in-game items last year. $0 went to players". This estimate is supported by a NewZoo report (graphic below) on the global games market, projecting $159bn would be spent by gamers in 2020.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The Immutable X engine offers speed and volume of transactions not yet seen in the space. Collectibles marketplaces do exist using Ethereum (NFTX, Rarible, Opensea, Beeple, Portion) but none are aimed specifically at the gaming sector and at present they are all limited by the congestion and costs of the Ethereum blockchain. Immutable aims to break away from this by implementing new scalability technology to its online exchange.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

There are several cutting edge technologies being leveraged to reach Immutable's end goal of disrupting mainstream gaming, and providing a scalable, user friendly, secure trading platform for gaming collectibles.

Immutable has chosen Ethereum as its blockchain home, and thus it will ultimately rely on smart contract coding, written in Solidity - Ethereum's native coding language. This allows the use of a unique and very useful token standard - ERC-721, also known as a 'Non-Fungible-Token'.

The core principal in focus here is ownership. Immutable uses NFT's to represent and solidify ownership of a digital asset (such as trading card, in game item or even digital artwork). This tokenized ownership can then be sold over an open market, allowing the user base to decide its worth. Given the transparent nature of a public blockchain, all sales, creations and transactions will be recorded and a sales history will be readily available for any item on the marketplace.

Immutable's exchange will be built on Immutable X, an engine that uses zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups on Ethereum, this is a scalability technology developed by Starkware, allowing massive groups of individual transactions to be batched and simultaneously verified by the blockchain, dramatically reducing costs and improving overall transaction rate (tps).

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Blockchain/Cryptocurrency

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

While this domain is still in its infancy, major trends have been centered around providing financial products and tools outside if the traditional finance realm. Decentralized exchanges, used to trade various crypto-currency assets make up the bulk of this movement but the NFT sector is expanding at an astronomical rate. The concept of tokenized ownership can be applied to almost any goods and/or services, not just art or gaming.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The blockchain/cryptocurrency domain consists of Companies as well as Decentralized entities and organizations. Major players include currency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Other blockchain based technology companies and entities that are emerging as competition for Ethereum are; Polkadot, Cardano, Solana and more.

In terms of direct competitors to Immutable, NFT exchanges such as Rarible as previously mentioned come to mind, however immutable aims to directly compete with major video-game labels offering in-game purchases such as EA Sports, Ubisoft, Rare, Epic games and Tencent games.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Immutable is still an emerging company using and creating emerging technology. Its impact will be seen as the Immutable X engine rolls out and the Immutable marketplace goes live. It is backed by powerful players in the blockchain investing world (Naspers Ventures, Apex Capital Partners) and the ease with which it was able to raise capital indicates strong conviction by investors in the space.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Information on financial performance is not yet available.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

As above.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

A logical and probable step for immutable would be to offer a secure digital wallet solution. Key areas of focus would be UX (user experience) and of course security for high value and rare assets.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The key to success with a business like Immutable is mass adoption. This would require a frictionless, simple user interface, providing for a user experience far superior to that which exists in the Ethereum ecosystem presently. If Immutable, using Immutable X can capture even a small percentage of market share of in-game purchasing it will be an immensely valuable platform with massive growth potential.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

For security it would be imperative to utilize multi-factor authentication, ensuring that malicious parties cannot seize control of a customers wallet. 

In terms of user experience a mobile solution would be vital, utilizing Android and iOS.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These are the technologies already in the hands of the consumer. A customer need not know that he/she is transacting on the Ethereum blockchain as long as they can buy, sell and play with little effort.
